##Issue: input text not showing up in firefox

Solution:

- set the height to 100%;
- change the unit to px;

Reason:

Normally the padding is too much. Try first removing the padding. The input field's text should be visible suddenly. Then set the height to 100%, and decrease the padding to make everything look fine.
